- **Power BI Desktop**: For creating visuals and dashboards.  
- **Power BI Query Editor**: For data cleaning and transformation.  
- Calculations of new measures such as:  
  - **ROI (Return on Investment)**  
  - **Region Number**  
  - **Conditional Column Calculations**

1. **Bar Charts**:  
   - Compare revenue and units sold across regions.  
2. **Line Graphs**:  
   - Display sales trends over two years.  
3. **Pie Charts**:  
   - Show percentage contributions of each region to total revenue.  
4. **Table Visuals**:  
   - Present detailed data summaries for better insights.  
5. **Cards**:  
   - Highlight key performance metrics like total revenue and ROI.  
6. **Maps**:  
   - Illustrate regional sales distribution and highlight states needing improvement.  
7. **Matrix Visuals**:  
   - Provide a grid layout for viewing revenue, units sold, and ROI by region and product categories in one consolidated view.  
8. **Metrics**:  
   - Showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:  
     - **Total Revenue**  
     - **Units Sold**  
     - **Average ROI**  

### Dashboards  
The dashboards created provide insights into:
